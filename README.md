# One day in VBZ world

The idea of this project is to visualize on a map all VBZ vehicles as the move across the city during the day, with special focus on dates of special events that affect the public transportation network.

## ZüriFäscht 2016

The following is a fraction of the 1st July 2016 visualized, the first day of ZüriFäscht 2016, and it is clearly visible how at around 18:35 all vehicles leave the central area of Zürich because the event is starting.
